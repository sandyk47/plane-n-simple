## PlaneSimple

The PlaneSimple marketplace is your portal to frictionless aviation asset transactions. Once in possession of your $PLNS tokens, you can use them to list your aircraft or lease a new aircraft, all in one simple interface.

At PlaneSimple we understand your aviation assets are valuable and need to be protected. Thatâ€™s why we let you specify your own terms for the lease agreement applicable to YOUR aircraft. These details will be stored securely on the InterPlanetary File System where they can never be lost or altered.

We utilize smart contracts on Ethereum to facilitate trustless transactions between the Owner and the Lessee. All funds will be locked in escrow until certain conditions are met for release, ensuring counter-party risk is at a minimum.

## $PLNS
$PLNS is a fungible token, built to the ERC-20 token standard. It is designed to be an all purpose alternate currency that allows owners and users to transact and lease in the PlaneSimple marketplace. 
	- Owners must use $PLNS to register aircraft and pay a listing fee
	- Operators must purchase $PLNS to pay their leasing costs to the aircraft owner.

$PLNS can be purchased through our initial crowdsale at a rate of .001ETH per PlaneToken. 

After the initial sale, all remaining $PLNS tokens will be burned and those that were purchased will be free to trade on the open market.
